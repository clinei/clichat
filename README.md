A chat application modeled after [Dark-Chat](http://dark-chat.info).

Current goal is to make a modular, statically compiled chat application framework.

Employs the [vibe.d](http://vibed.org) framework for I/O.

Written in [D](http://dlang.org).

Currently uses WebSockets for communication, but XHR support is planned.

Check [TODO](TODO.md) before making a feature request.
